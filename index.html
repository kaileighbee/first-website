I'm your basic average girl
And I'm here to save the world
You can't stop me 
Cause I'm Kim Pos-si-ble
There is nothin I can't do
When danger calls
Just know that I am on my way (know that i am on my way)

It doesn't matter where or when there's trouble
If ya just call my name
Kim Possible

[Chorus]
Call me, beep me if ya wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything's gonna be alright
Whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya wanna reach me

(Kim here, so what's the sitch?)

Message clear I am hear let me reassure you
I never going to leave you alone 
(I am, I am on my way)
You can always count on me
When it gets dark I'll help you see
I will help you find your way (help you find your way)

It doesn't matter when there's trouble
If ya just call my name

[Chorus]

(Call me
Beep me
If ya wanna reach me
If ya wanna beep me
It's okay)

Doesn't matter where
Doesn't matter when
I will be there for ya til the very end
Danger or trouble
I'm there on the double
You know that you always can call
Kim Possible

Yeaahh yeaah

Call me, beep me if ya wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything is gonna be alright
Whenever ya need me, whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything's gonna be alright
Whenever ya need me baby,
Call me, beep me if ya wanna reach me
Yeah Yeah Yeah
